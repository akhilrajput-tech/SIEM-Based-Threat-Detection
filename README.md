# SIEM-Based-Threat-Detection

# 📊 SIEM-Based Threat Detection

## 📌 Project Overview
This project demonstrates a **SIEM-Based Threat Detection** simulation focused on understanding how security events and logs are analyzed to detect potential cyber threats.

The project is **conceptual and learning-based**, designed to explain SIEM workflows, detection logic, and incident identification without using a live enterprise SIEM environment.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Understand SIEM fundamentals and architecture
- Learn how logs are collected and analyzed
- Study threat detection use cases
- Understand alerting and monitoring concepts
- Prepare for SOC Analyst (L1) roles

---

## 🛠️ SIEM Concepts Covered
- Log collection and normalization
- Event correlation
- Threat detection logic
- Alerts and incident identification
- Basic SOC workflow understanding

---

## 📥 Log Sources Studied
- Authentication logs
- System and server logs
- Network logs
- Application logs

---

## 🚨 Threat Detection Use Cases (Conceptual)

### 1️⃣ Brute Force Login Attempts
- Multiple failed login attempts from same source
- Detection using threshold-based rules

### 2️⃣ Suspicious Login Activity
- Login attempts from unusual locations or times
- Abnormal user behavior patterns

### 3️⃣ Malware or Suspicious Process Indicators
- Unknown or unusual process execution
- Abnormal system activity

### 4️⃣ Network Anomalies
- Unusual traffic volume
- Repeated connection attempts to restricted ports

---

## 🧪 Detection Methodology (Simulation-Based)
1. Analyze different log sources
2. Identify suspicious patterns
3. Apply correlation logic conceptually
4. Generate alerts based on detection rules
5. Understand incident severity and impact

---

## 📊 Outcomes
- Strong understanding of SIEM working
- Knowledge of SOC alert analysis
- Awareness of real-world detection scenarios
- Improved incident response mindset

---

## 🧠 Key Learnings
- SIEM helps in early threat detection
- Logs are critical for security visibility
- Correlation improves detection accuracy
- Alerts must be analyzed, not blindly trusted
